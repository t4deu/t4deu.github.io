			"description": "Working at this FinTech, My first challenge was to reshape the transactions API into a more robust and scalable solution. So I proposed, designed, and implemented a new GraphQL API using a microservice structure while exposing a single data graph to the API clients. <strong>Successfully becoming the standard for the company and being applied to all remaining APIs</strong>. So far, I maintain ownership of the evolution and the architectural guidelines of the Graphql API.<br><br>After that, I aimed at our frontend, becoming the tech leader of the FullStack development team, responsible for leading, training, conducting code reviews, and architectural meetings. Successfully delivering our React-based administration platform, where we currently manage thousands of users, payments, deposits, and bank transfers.<br><br>My next challenge was to develop a b2b financial service from the ground up, delivering the POC in weeks, but quickly evolving it into one of the company's main products."
