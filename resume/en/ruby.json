  "about": "I'm a web and mobile developer with more than 4 years of experience in rails, android and angularjs. I have worked on development of mobile solutions for major clients such as Lafarge a french industrial company and the CAHP Credit Union.
<br>
A recent deployed project was the Investor Relationship apps of Cielo credit card operator and Santander bank.
<br>
Colleagues know me by my creativity and development skills. But I know that the client's business comes first, and effective results are better code perfection.
<br>
I'm a specimen in constant evolution, learning and trying, like a shark that can't stop swimming. I love to work on different projects, especially if it's not on my current know-how.
<br>
If you have a freelance or remote job, contact me, I'm available.",
