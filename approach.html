          My personal dedication to every project leads me to look deeper at problems and not accept things at face value. I don’t fall in love with the first solution or the fifth; there’s always something better to be built. I'm constantly challenging my assumptions and i’ll do the same with yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          This combination of curiosity and persistence allows me to excel in high-stakes projects. Always aiming for big impact with my work, and my love for quality and results.

        <h3>Transformational development</h3>
        <p>
          If you’re a startup founder with an idea, I turn it into a fully formed product.
          <br>
          If you’re part of a big company whose product has a missing features and poor experience, I will remove the bad parts and put quality, performance and growth in place.

        <h3>Supporting David and Goliath</h3>
        <p>
          I love work with projects across the growth spectrum. I infuse a startup-like energy with fast results and lean approach into large company projects,
          and bring the quality and discipline from my knowledge and experience into startups teans. This interconnectedness is where the magic happens.

        <h3>Results oriented</h3>
        <p>
          My goal is to solve your problems and achieve the results that
          matter as fast as possible, not deliver lines of code.
          For this reason I will always create what is really necessary for you, using the right tools for the right problems.

      <div class="column">
        <h3>A flexible approach</h3>
        <p>
          It’s in my DNA to be adaptive. I was born in the flexible environment, molded by it.
          I didn't see the light until I was already a man. By then it was nothing to me but blinding!
          A true full stack developer, cabable of work in any party of a project and comunicate well with all the team.
